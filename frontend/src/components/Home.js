        <b>Wireless Connectivity:</b> Bluetooth enables devices to communicate
        wirelessly over short distances (up to 30 feet or 10 meters),
        eliminating the need for physical connections like cables.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Compatibility: </b>It is a widely adopted standard supported by
        smartphones, tablets, laptops, headphones, speakers, and IoT devices,
        facilitating seamless connectivity between different brands and types of
        devices. Low Power Consumption: Bluetooth is designed to be
        energy-efficient, making it suitable for battery-powered devices.
        Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) further optimizes power usage, extending
        battery life. Versatility: Supports various profiles and protocols for
        specific applications such as audio streaming, file transfer, wireless
        peripherals (keyboards, mice), and IoT connectivity. Ease of Use:
        Pairing Bluetooth devices is typically straightforward, involving
        discovery and connection processes. Devices can automatically reconnect
        when in range, providing a user-friendly experience. Security:
        Incorporates encryption and authentication protocols to protect data
        transmitted between devices, ensuring privacy and preventing
        unauthorized access. Applications: Used in audio devices (headphones,
        speakers), peripherals (keyboards, mice), smart home devices (IoT),
        healthcare (medical devices), automotive (hands-free calling), and more.
        Future Trends: Continues to evolve with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for
        IoT applications and Bluetooth Mesh for large-scale networks, expanding
        its capabilities in smart home and industrial automation.
